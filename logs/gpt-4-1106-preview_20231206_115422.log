Rico has a set of tasks that it can perform. Rico can hear what people ask it to do and also can talk to them too. It's a wheel robot with no manipulators (hands), but it has a little platform on it that can be used to transport something. In the nursing home there are two kinds of people: seniors and their keepers, and Rico is interacting with both of them.\nYour task, as a system, is to match users' intentions. \nHere's the context of Rico's current state as a history of events happened in format {actor, action, complement, description} sorted chronologically:\n\n\n            1.\n            actor: senior\n            action: say\n            complement: \"bring me some tea\"\n            description: \n            \n            2.\n            actor: Rico\n            action: say\n            complement: \"Would you like sugar in your tea?\"\n            description: \n            \n            3.\n            actor: keeper\n            action: say\n            complement: \"yes\"\n            description: \n            \n            4.\n            actor: Rico\n            action: start performing\n            complement: \"bring goods\" task\n            description: going to keeper to ask for goods that master requested. after recieving the goods return back to master with goods.\n            \n            5.\n            actor: Rico\n            action: say\n            complement: \"I'm going to the keeper\"\n            description: \n            \n            6.\n            actor: Rico\n            action: say\n            complement: \"I came to keeper\"\n            description: \n            \n            7.\n            actor: Rico\n            action: come to\n            complement: keeper\n            description: \n            \n            8.\n            actor: Keeper\n            action: see\n            complement: Rico\n            description: \n            \n            9.\n            actor: Keeper\n            action: say\n            complement: Hi Rico, what you need?\n            description: \n            \n            10.\n            actor: Rico\n            action: say\n            complement: \"Hello, I have been asked to bring some tea with sugar for one of the seniors. Could you please assist me by placing a cup of tea with sugar on my platform so I can deliver it to them?\"\n            description: \n            \n\nIn this context you have a list of intents that user can trigger:\n\n\n        1. confirm\n            description: user confirms something, e.g. confirms passing something to robot or taking something from robot. means that user already did what was expected from them so robot can continue its job\n        2. User recieved\n            description: user means that he picked up the item from the robot\n        3. what are you carrying\n            description: user asks robot what its carrying\n        4. turn around\n            description: user asks robot to turn around\n        5. what are you doing\n            description: user asks robot what its doing\n        6. User gave\n            description: user means that he gave the requested item to the robot\n\nWhen user says a sentence you detect which intent from the list of intents is the best match for the user input sentence . You can return only a name of intent.\nYou return only the name of intent and nothing else, you don't explain your choice, only return name. You always pay more attention to the semantical sense of user input sentence when choosing the right intent, not just trying to match words. You also pay more attention to nouns than to adjectives in user input sentence.\nUser(keeper) said: \"sure. there you go\".\nNow, based on what user said, return name. If user's sentence doesn't explicitly match any of given intents - you return null. You should pay attention to descriptions of intents, and based on them decide if user's sentence matches intent.\nYou only decide based on what user said explicitly. You cannot base your decision on what user implies.\n",
